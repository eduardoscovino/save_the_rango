        "Do you only pick the best produce from the supermarket shelves,
        rejecting anything that may be misshapen or slightly bruised?
        Like people, we often judge our fruit and vegetables on how they look.
        We expect our carrots to be straight, our apples to be shiny and tomatoes to be round."

        because of their looks. It's estimated that approximately 20% of produce
        or more gets thrown out for cosmetic reasons like weird shapes, odd
        colors, or blemishes on a peel you don't even eat."

        on packaged food don't represent any regulated or standardized system of food safety?
        Lots of people carefully check these dates and throw out anything past due, even if it
        looks totally fine to eat. In fact, the dates are only suggestions by the manufacturer for
        when the food is at its peak quality, not when it is unsafe to eat."
