          <p class="card-text">Do you only pick the best produce from the supermarket shelves,
            rejecting anything that may be misshapen or slightly bruised?
            Like people, we often judge our fruit and vegetables on how they look.
            We expect our carrots to be straight, our apples to be shiny and tomatoes to be round.

            Tons of food (literally, many tons) are wasted every year just because of looks.
            It's estimated that approximately 20% of produce or more gets thrown out for cosmetic reasons
            like weird shapes, odd colors, or blemishes on a peel you don't even eat.

            That's 1 in 5 fruits and vegetables getting tossed into landfill even though they're just as nutritious and delicious to eat.

            Did you know that the expiration dates we commonly see on packaged food (i.e. Sell By, Best By, Use By, and Best Before)
            don't represent any regulated or standardized system of food safety?
            Lots of people carefully check these dates and throw out anything past due,
            even if it looks totally fine to eat. In fact, the dates are only suggestions by the manufacturer
            for when the food is at its peak quality, not when it is unsafe to eat.</p>
            <!-- <p>
            According to the National Resources Defense Council: 'The current system of expiration dates misleads consumers to believe
            they must discard food in order to protect their own safety. In fact, the dates are only suggestions by the manufacturer
            for when the food is at its peak quality, not when it is unsafe to eat.
